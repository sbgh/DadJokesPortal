  Make a small web application. It will have one page with a large text input, 1 button, and an output area. The user will put text into the input, click one of the buttons, and the application will transform the text in some way and display the result in the output area. The work can be done by the server or the client.
  
  Requirements
  You can use any language, framework, or library as long as you write your own code for the actual page.
  You don't have to put it online anywhere, we just want to look at that code. We donâ€™t have to be able to compile or run it.
  Send me the source code as a link to a git repository I can clone.
